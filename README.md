- 👋 Hi, I’m @calebRyanHenry
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, learning, and learning. I've always loved to learn and programming has been one of the
        few things I can add to the list of subjects that satiate my curiosity. Growing up, I fell in love first with
        Physics, then with Math, and now with how to turn a computer inside out and back together again. My goal
        is to learn as many languages as possible, ideally before my head explodes.
        
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# primarily, but I have a bad habit of trying to learn a bunch of things simultaneously.
        I've learned the most important basics of Java but have been continuing to round out my knowledge
        using resources such as HackerRank to practice on sample interview coding questions. I even like to spend some time
        working on personal projects.
        
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about literally anything.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
